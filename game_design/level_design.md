# Level Design

## Environment Types

### Fractured Farmlands
- **Visual Theme:** Abandoned farms with mutated crops and irrigation systems
- **Hazards:** Pesticide puddles, unstable structures, aggressive plant life
- **Cover Elements:** Broken tractors, farm equipment, collapsed barns
- **Resource Nodes:** Clean water pumps, seed storage, fertilizer stockpiles
- **Weather Effects:** Toxic rain that increases contamination when outdoors

### Toxic Processing Plants
- **Visual Theme:** Industrial facilities with pipes, vats, and chemical processing equipment
- **Hazards:** Steam vents, chemical spills, automated defense systems
- **Cover Elements:** Storage containers, machinery, office furniture
- **Resource Nodes:** Chemical samples, purification stations, research data
- **Verticality:** Catwalks, ladders, pipe networks for multi-level combat

### Underground Root Networks
- **Visual Theme:** Massive root systems with bioluminescent elements and natural caverns
- **Hazards:** Collapsing tunnels, predatory insects, toxic spore clouds
- **Cover Elements:** Root structures, rock formations, abandoned mining equipment
- **Resource Nodes:** Pristine water pools, rare mineral deposits, ancient seeds
- **Navigation:** Complex 3D pathways requiring special traversal abilities

### Mutant Research Facilities
- **Visual Theme:** Sterile labs with containment units and experimental gardens
- **Hazards:** Escaped test subjects, malfunctioning equipment, containment breaches
- **Cover Elements:** Lab benches, specimen storage, overturned equipment
- **Resource Nodes:** Research data, experimental mutagens, advanced equipment
- **Stealth Elements:** Security systems that can be avoided or hacked

## Level Design Principles

### Combat Spaces
- **Encounter Types:**
  - **Ambush Points:** Enemies hiding in vegetation or structures
  - **Arena Battles:** Open areas with multiple approach vectors and hazards
  - **Corridor Fights:** Tight spaces forcing close combat
  - **Sniper Zones:** Long sightlines with limited cover
- **Cover Density:** 60% combat areas have cover, 30% partial cover, 10% open ground

### Resource Gathering
- **Distribution Pattern:** Critical resources on main path, rare resources in dangerous side areas
- **Risk vs. Reward:** Most valuable resources placed in high contamination zones
- **Hidden Caches:** Secret areas containing rare upgrades and collectibles
- **Timed Opportunities:** Certain resources available only during specific environmental conditions

### Environmental Storytelling
- **Abandoned Logs:** Research notes and personal journals revealing backstory
- **Visual Scenes:** Environmental setups showing what happened to previous inhabitants
- **Audio Logs:** Triggered voice recordings from before and during the catastrophe
- **Graffiti:** Faction markings and warnings left by survivors

### Level Flow Control
- **Gating Mechanisms:**
  - **Ability Gates:** Areas requiring specific mutations or abilities
  - **Contamination Gates:** Zones requiring contamination resistance
  - **Combat Gates:** Enemy encounters that must be defeated to progress
  - **Puzzle Gates:** Environmental challenges requiring specific solutions
- **Pacing:** Alternating high-intensity combat areas with exploration and resource zones
