- Underground research facilities established in remote farming regions

### 2029: Project Genesis
- Agri-Shield announces "Project Genesis" - revolutionary crop protection
- Early tests show alarming mutation rates in soil samples
- Internal whistleblowers silenced through corporate means
- Government regulators bribed to fast-track approval

### 2030: Initial Deployment
- First-generation mutagenic pesticides deployed in controlled regions
- Unprecedented crop yields reported in test areas
- Strange plant behaviors documented but suppressed from public knowledge

## The Catastrophe

### 2031: The Withered Soil Incident

- Collapse of global food supply chains and governmental structures

### 2033: The Silent Year
- Communication networks fail as infrastructure collapses
- Remaining humans retreat to isolated safe zones
- Rapid evolution of plant life in contaminated regions
- First primitive plant societies begin to form

## Post-Catastrophe Era

- Agri-Shield facilities become objectives for scavenging and revenge

### 2037-2039: Factional Development
- Formation of the Root Resistance from carrots and root vegetables
- Emergence of the Blight Brethren cult worshipping contamination
- Establishment of the mercenary Seasoning Syndicate
- Sunshard Council forms from scientifically-minded corn and grains

### 2040: Current Game Timeline
- Root Resistance establishes first major clean soil settlement
