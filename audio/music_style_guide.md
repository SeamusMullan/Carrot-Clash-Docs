# Musical Style Guide

This document provides guidance on the musical styles, instrumentation, and tone for each section of the Carrot Clash soundtrack.

## Overall Audio Direction

The Carrot Clash soundtrack embraces a cartoon-inspired musical approach that complements the game's visual style, drawing inspiration from:

- **Plants vs. Zombies Garden Warfare**: Quirky, playful melodies with organic sounds
- **Sunset Overdrive**: Energetic punk and electronic fusion with bright, exaggerated tones
- **Borderlands**: Gritty Western elements mixed with electronic and industrial sounds
- **Mirror's Edge**: Clean, minimalist electronic sections for the more clinical areas

### Core Audio Philosophy
- **Organic/Synthetic Fusion**: Blend natural instruments with electronic processing
- **Exaggerated Expression**: Bold dynamics and theatrical musical moments
- **Faction Identity**: Distinctive musical signatures for each vegetable faction
- **Tonal Contrast**: Clear musical distinction between pure and contaminated areas
- **Cartoon Timing**: Music that supports exaggerated animation with accent hits and stingers

## Faction Musical Identities

### Root Resistance
- **Primary Style**: Military-inspired orchestration with folk/roots undertones
- **Key Instruments**: Heroic brass, military percussion, acoustic strings, earthy bass
- **Melodic Approach**: Determined, march-like themes with hopeful major key resolutions
- **Reference Tracks**: "Medal of Honor" soundtrack meets "Team Fortress 2" with vegetable themes
- **Processing**: Minimal, natural reverb with occasional radio filtering for communications

### Blight Brethren
- **Primary Style**: Dissonant industrial with glitch elements and unsettling textures
- **Key Instruments**: Processed synthesizers, distorted bass, corrupted samples, eerie pads
- **Melodic Approach**: Unstable, shifting harmonies with unexpected tonal shifts
- **Reference Tracks**: Borderlands' psycho themes meets horror game dissonance
- **Processing**: Heavy processing, toxic "bubbling" effects, pitch warping

### Seasoning Syndicate
- **Primary Style**: Swagger-filled jazz fusion with Latin percussion and funk elements
- **Key Instruments**: Brass stabs, congas and bongos, slap bass, vibrant keyboards
- **Melodic Approach**: Confident, syncopated melodies with spicy chromatic runs

- **Melodic Approach**: Harmonically complex progressions with light leitmotifs
- **Reference Tracks**: Mirror's Edge ambient meets Avatar (film) spiritual themes
- **Processing**: Spacious reverb, subtle light-inspired shimmer effects

## Environment-Specific Approaches

### Fractured Farmlands
- **Primary Style**: Americana/folk with post-apocalyptic undertones
- **Key Instruments**: Acoustic guitar, harmonica, fiddle, banjo, atmospheric pads
- **Dynamic Range**: Open, spacious mixes with distant elements suggesting vast fields
- **Special Techniques**: Incorporate subtle farming tool sounds as percussive elements

### Toxic Processing Plants
- **Primary Style**: Industrial rhythmic with mechanical precision
- **Key Instruments**: Metallic percussion, steam/hiss samples, factory rhythm loops
- **Dynamic Range**: Dense, mid-heavy soundscapes with claustrophobic feeling
- **Special Techniques**: Use of actual machinery recordings processed into musical elements

### Underground Root Networks
- **Primary Style**: Mysterious ambient with bioluminescent "glow"
- **Key Instruments**: Subterranean bass drones, water droplet percussion, crystalline textures
- **Dynamic Range**: Deep sub frequencies contrasted with delicate high elements
- **Special Techniques**: Convolution reverb using cave impulse responses

### Mutant Research Facilities
- **Primary Style**: Clinical electronic with scientific precision
- **Key Instruments**: Analog synthesizers, digital bleeps, sterile percussion, laboratory samples
- **Dynamic Range**: Clean separation between elements, surgical mix approach
- **Special Techniques**: Incorporate laboratory equipment sounds (centrifuges, test tubes, etc.)

## Combat Music System

### Layering Approach
- **Base Layer**: Persistent rhythm and foundational harmony always active
- **Intensity Layer 1**: Adds when enemies first spotted, introduces melodic elements
- **Intensity Layer 2**: Activates during active combat, adds percussive elements and countermelodies
- **Intensity Layer 3**: Triggers during elite enemies or high danger, adds brass stabs and final elements
- **Transition System**: Custom-composed transition elements between intensity states (2-3 seconds each)

### Boss Battle Philosophy
- **Phase-Based Development**: Music evolves through each boss phase with increasing intensity
- **Character Leitmotifs**: Each boss's theme incorporates their faction's musical identity
- **Transformation Moments**: Special stingers for boss mutation or phase change moments
- **Victory Resolution**: Triumphant resolution themes with callback to core game motifs

## Technical Implementation Notes

### Interactive Music System
- **Horizontal Re-sequencing**: For exploration to combat transitions
- **Vertical Layering**: For combat intensity system
- **Stingers**: 1-2 second musical accents for key gameplay moments
- **Parameter-Based Mixing**: Real-time adjustment of mix elements based on:
  * Contamination level
  * Health status
  * Enemy proximity
  * Environment type

### Mixing Guidelines
- **Combat Mix**: Duck ambient sounds, boost percussion and mid-range
- **Exploration Mix**: Emphasize ambient sounds, subtle musical elements
- **Drama Mix**: Full orchestral range for cinematics and key moments
- **End User Control**: Allow players to adjust music/SFX/voice independently

## Audio Reference Palette

### Root Elements (Natural Sounds)
