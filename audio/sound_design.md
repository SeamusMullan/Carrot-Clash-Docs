# Sound Design

## Audio Design Philosophy

### Core Audio Principles
- **Organic Soundscape:** Audio rooted in natural, plant-based sources
- **Contamination Audio:** Distinct sound profile for mutated elements
- **Reactive Environment:** Dynamic audio responding to player actions and game state
- **Spatial Awareness:** Clear audio positioning for tactical gameplay
- **Emotional Reinforcement:** Sound design supporting narrative themes

### Audio Palette
- **Root Resistance:** Natural, earthy tones with military precision
- **Blight Brethren:** Dissonant, unsettling mutations of natural sounds
- **Seasoning Syndicate:** Rhythmic, percussion-heavy with spice rattles
- **Sunshard Council:** Clean, harmonious tones with technological elements
- **Contamination:** Distinctive audio distortion increasing with exposure

### Sound Categories
- **Diegetic:** Sounds originating from in-game sources
  - Character movement and abilities
  - Environmental objects and hazards
  - Weapons and equipment
  - NPC vocalizations
  - Weather and atmosphere
- **Non-Diegetic:** Sounds for player feedback
  - UI notifications and feedback
  - Score and ambient music
  - Status effect indicators
  - Achievement/progression rewards
  - Tutorial guidance
