# Voice Acting

## Voice Direction Philosophy

### Core Voice Principles
- **Plant-Based Physiology:** Vocal characteristics reflecting vegetable anatomy
- **Faction Identity:** Distinctive vocal treatments for different groups
- **Contamination Effects:** Progressive vocal distortion with mutation levels
- **Emotional Range:** Full spectrum of expression despite non-human characters
- **Consistent World:** Unified approach to how sentient plants would vocalize

### Character Voice Categories
- **Root Resistance:** Clear, determined, militaristic with earthy tones
- **Blight Brethren:** Distorted, reverberant, with unsettling harmonics
- **Seasoning Syndicate:** Energetic, varied pitch, rhythmic speech patterns
- **Sunshard Council:** Precise, measured, with clinical clarity
- **Independent Characters:** Unique vocal treatments reflecting personal history

### Processing Techniques
- **Vegetable Physiology:**
  - Subtle resonance adjustments based on plant type
  - Minor pitch modulation for plant-specific characteristics
  - Organic reverb suggesting internal structure
  - Textural layering for plant tissue simulation
  - Species-specific processing presets
- **Contamination Levels:**
  - Progressive distortion correlating with mutation
  - Harmonic enhancers for unnaturally perfect tones
  - Granular disruption for degraded speech
  - Layered voices for multiple growth formations
  - Dynamic filtering based on character state
