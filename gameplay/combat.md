# Combat System

## Core Combat Mechanics

### Attack Types
- **Ranged Combat:** Primary method for most classes
  - Hitscan weapons (instant hit, precise aiming)
  - Projectile weapons (travel time, ballistic trajectory)
  - Charge weapons (hold to increase damage)
  - Area-of-effect weapons (splash damage, status effects)
- **Melee Combat:** Secondary option for close encounters
  - Quick strikes (fast, low damage)
  - Heavy attacks (slower, high damage, knockback)
  - Combo chains (sequential inputs for enhanced damage)
  - Special moves (class-specific melee abilities)

### Defensive Mechanics
- **Cover System:** Characters gain damage reduction when behind terrain
  - Full cover: 75% damage reduction
  - Partial cover: 40% damage reduction
  - Destructible cover: Degrades with sustained damage
- **Dodging:** Tactical movement to avoid attacks
  - Directional dodges with brief invulnerability frames
  - Cooldown-based to prevent spam
  - Class-specific dodge variations (distance, effects)
- **Block/Parry:** For melee-focused characters
  - Timing-based mechanics for reduced damage or counterattacks
  - Resource consumption (stamina/energy)

### Health & Recovery
- **Health System:** Segmented health bar with regeneration mechanics
  - Base health varies by class
  - Partial regeneration for damaged segments after time out of combat
  - Critical health state with visual/audio indicators below 20%
- **Recovery Methods:**
  - Consumable items (instant, limited quantity)
  - Seeder abilities (moderate, cooldown-based)
  - Environmental stations (high healing, fixed locations)
  - Base return (full healing, requires extraction)

## Status Effects

### Positive Status Effects
- **Fortified:** Increased damage resistance (10-30%)
- **Accelerated:** Movement and attack speed increase (15-25%)
- **Rejuvenating:** Health regeneration over time
- **Empowered:** Damage output increase (10-30%)
- **Cleansed:** Temporary immunity to contamination

### Negative Status Effects
- **Contaminated:** Increasing severity of vision distortion and damage over time
- **Rooted:** Movement speed reduction or immobilization
- **Burning:** Damage over time with visual fire effects
- **Corroded:** Armor/defense reduction
- **Disoriented:** Reduced accuracy and impaired controls

## Enemy Combat Behaviors

### Attack Patterns
- **Melee Rushers:** Aggressive enemies that charge directly at players
- **Ranged Attackers:** Maintain distance while firing projectiles
- **Ambushers:** Hide and surprise players with burst damage
- **Area Deniers:** Create hazardous zones players must avoid
- **Support Units:** Enhance other enemies or repair damaged units

### Enemy Coordination

- **Flanking Behavior:** Attempts to attack from multiple angles
- **Retreating:** Falling back when heavily damaged
- **Reinforcement Calls:** Alerting nearby enemies when engaged
- **Elite Support:** Special enemies providing buffs to regular units

## Environmental Combat

### Interactive Elements
- **Explosive Containers:** Can be shot to damage nearby enemies
- **Toxic Pools:** Can be used strategically to contaminate enemies
- **Growth Nodes:** Can be activated to create zone buffs or hazards
- **Weather Systems:** Dynamic conditions affecting combat parameters
- **Terrain Manipulation:** Some abilities can alter the battlefield

### Hazard Types
- **Spray Zones:** Areas with high contamination risk
- **Unstable Ground:** Collapsing terrain that can damage or trap
- **Electric Fields:** Damage over time with movement impairment
- **Mutant Spores:** Vision impairment and potential status effects
- **Radiation Pockets:** High damage zones requiring special protection
